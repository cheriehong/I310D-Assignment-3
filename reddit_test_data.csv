"When i was a kid, I was told by media we would run out of clean water by 2015, but we still got water.  I was told that we would run out of oil by 2010, but we still got oil and fuel.  I was told plastic bottles would destroy the ecosystem because nothing can dispose them, then we discovered a bacteria that eats plastics.  I was told that we would run out of food, but yet we still got plenty of food.  I know that this isn't the case everywhere, but in my country, the same country that told me it would affect us is the same country that has not been affected.  Our media is in business to create fear, to create unrest so they have a story to tell.  Fuck the media, fuck politics, I am going to live my life the best way I know how.  Love my family, raise my kids to not waste food and supplies and treat people the way they want to be treated.  It seems simple, but if everyone did these things the world will be a better place.",0.059232414,0,1,No

"I'm pretty sure I've seen trans people themselves say that it's a mental illness as in it's a problem in their brain. Is ""mental illness"" an insult now?

"I'd say it's quite the contrary. I do whatever the fuck I want, whenever the fuck I want, I work from home sans pants, I take vacations 2 or 3 times a year, I wake up at whatever hour, go to bed whenever I want, and most of my income is disposable. Meanwhile I see my married friends get bitched out every time they go out for a beer and return just a little bit late, while they basically work 24/7 as glorified chauffeurs for their wives and kids.
